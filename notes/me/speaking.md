## 2025

I didn't get to do as much speaking as I'd like in 2025. I'm currently splitting
my time living between London and Brussels, and that means I've not been as free
to travel around Europe for conferences and meetups. Still, I managed to speak
at my two favourite conferences so I can't complain!
