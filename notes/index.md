# Hey stranger, I'm Hayleigh.

I'm a frontend-shaped developer with a soft spot for functional programming. You
might have run into me in the [Elm slack](https://elmlang.slack.com), seen I was
a member of the [Gleam](https://gleam.run) core team, or heard of my frontend
framework [Lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre).

If you have no idea about any of those things, don't worry! Here are some links
to get to know me better:

- [A list of the talks I've given.][@me/speaking]
- [Any post tagged with "me" (including this one!)][@tags/me]
