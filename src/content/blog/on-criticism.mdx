A [blog post](https://kevinyank.com/posts/on-endings-why-how-we-retired-elm-at-culture-amp/)
about Elm has been making the rounds lately. It's a thoughtful and well-written
post describing why (and how) Culture Amp decided to move away from Elm: you should
totally read it if you haven't already. I'm not going to touch on the technical
reasons you might (or might not) want to use Elm, but instead look at a quote
that stood out to me:

> I tell myself that it would be rude and ungrateful to the Elm community for me
> to publicly declare Culture Amp's departure from the fold, ...

This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I've been active in the
Elm community for over four years now and in that time I've made a few friends,
helped a lot of people, and landed my first (and second, and third, and fourth)
job thanks to that community. Yet no community is perfect, and certainly no
language is either, so why is it that we feel like we shouldn't publicly
criticise Elm?

The rest of this post doesn't really tell a story, and I'm not even sure it comes
to a satisfying conclusion. Instead, this is my attempt to answer that question
for myself: maybe you'll find it interesting or useful too.

## Toxic positivity

## Elm has an image problem

## Our careers are at stake

## It's holding the language back

## We are powerless

I think this will be met with a bit of pushback so first let me recognise that
there are many individuals putting in some serious work to make Elm better. There
are too many to list in fact, but some notable projects include [lamdera](https://www.lamdera.com),
[elm-review](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/),
and [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com).

As great as these projects (and others) are, they are all making up for things
lacking in the language itself. This boils down to Elm's approach to governence
and unwillingness to accept external contributions, a criticism that has been
played to death, but I think this is just another reason why many are reluctant
to speak out: why bother when we cannot affect change?

This one I find personally very frustrating. There are _so many_ talented and
enthusiastic people in the community and their efforts are made so much harder

## What now?
